    <p>There are several new features being prepared in the upcoming Psycopg version. The <a class="reference external" href="/docs/">documentation</a> refers to it as release 2.2.3 but it may be ultimately released as 2.3. The main target of the release is to expose some of the new features introduced in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.postgresql.org/about/news.1235">PostgreSQL 9.0</a>.</p>
<!-- CUT-HERE -->
<p><strong>Update</strong> The new features <a class="reference external" href="/psycopg/articles/2010/11/06/psycopg-230-beta1-released/">have been released</a> in <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/packages/source/p/psycopg2/psycopg2-2.3.0-beta1.tar.gz">Psycopg 2.3.0-beta1</a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="dict-to-hstore-mapping">
<h2><tt class="docutils literal">dict</tt> to <tt class="docutils literal">hstore</tt> mapping</h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.0/static/hstore.html"><tt class="docutils literal">hstore</tt></a> is a very interesting data type available in PostgreSQL: each <tt class="docutils literal">hstore</tt> value is a set of key/value pairs . In the release 9.0 <tt class="docutils literal">hstore</tt> received a lot of improvements that made it still more useful. Building an index on an <tt class="docutils literal">hstore</tt> column will allow fast search for values containing one or more provided keys/values. The new Psycopg release will allow to map Python dictionaries into <tt class="docutils literal">hstore</tt> and back. String and Unicode keys and values are supported: you can find here <a class="reference external" href="/docs/extras.html#hstore-data-type">documentation</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.develer.com/gitweb/pub?p=users/piro/psycopg2.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/adapt-dict">implementation</a> in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">adapt-dict</span></tt> git branch.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="notify-payload">
<h2>Notify payload</h2>
<p>PostgreSQL includes an <a class="reference external" href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.0/static/sql-notify.html">asynchronous notification mechanism</a> allowing clients to subscribe to a certain notification channel and receive events from the database, allowing efficient communication between processes connected to the same database. Previously only the channel name could be notified: in PostgreSQL 9.0 a payload string can be attached to an event, allowing more flexible communication: if previously a listening client could have been notified about data changed in a specific value, it is now possible, for instance, to report <em>which record</em> has been modified. The mechanism is completely generic and it's up to the client applications to find a good use for it. Here you can find <a class="reference external" href="/docs/advanced.html#asynchronous-notifications">documentation</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.develer.com/gitweb/pub?p=users/piro/psycopg2.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/notify-payload">implementation</a> for the notification payload in Psycopg.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="two-phase-commit">
<h2>Two-phase commit</h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href=":">Two-phase commit</a> is actually <a class="reference external" href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.0/static/sql-prepare-transaction.html">supported by PostgreSQL</a> since release 8.1: it enables the database to participate in distributed operations with transactional characteristics. You can find here <a class="reference external" href="/docs/usage.html#two-phase-commit-protocol-support">documentation</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.develer.com/gitweb/pub?p=users/piro/psycopg2.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/tpc">implementation</a> in the git <tt class="docutils literal">tpc</tt> branch.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/">Python DBAPI 2.0</a> suggests a specific interface for 2pc-related methods that maps fine enough on PostgreSQL commands. What maps slightly worse is the format chosen for the distributed transactions identifiers: the DBAPI is inspired to the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.opengroup.org/bookstore/catalog/c193.htm">Open Group XA specification</a> according to which every transaction is identifies by a triple (<em>format id</em>, <em>global transaction id</em>, <em>branch qualifier</em>). PostgreSQL doesn't follow this standard and accepts any string (up to a certain length) as a transaction identifier: this creates the need to map from triples to strings and back. We have currently implemented the same algorithm used in the JDBC driver: it works fine but has the drawback of producing unreadable strings as transaction ids. We may use something different, such as concatenating the elements of a xid with a specific character (e.g. <tt class="docutils literal">:</tt>) and escaping colons provided in the xid components. Would it be more valuable to have readable transaction identifiers or interoperation with Java tools? I don't have much experience about the matter, so any suggestion would be appreciated.</p>
<p>Please feel free to check the new features details in the documentation, to try the code under development and to leave  your feedback!</p>
